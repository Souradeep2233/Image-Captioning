Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.

Here we have used Convolutional Neural Network for extracting the low level features from images for classifying or comprehending an image.

For NLP , we have used Recurrent Neural Network for processing the captions. 

The feature vector from images and word embeddings are fed to LSTM architecture, from where the model has been trained to predict a caption corresponding to a given  image. 
## Model Architecture and Applications

## Run Locally

1. Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Souradeep2233/Image-Captioning.git
```

2. Install the dataset from this link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k

3. Change the paths refered to dataset materials in the .ipynb file according to running environment platform or local machine.

4. Wait patiently for the training to be over & eventually our desired image captioning will be achieved.
